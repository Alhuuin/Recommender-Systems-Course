# Lecture Content

Here we collect the content of lectures for the Recommender Systems course.

## 1. Filters and users vectors

We are going to define _item_ and _user_ vectors, their geometrical meaning, etc. We will define _distance metrics_, also by implementing some examples of those.

Finally, we will build the simplest recommendation model possible: the most popular recommendation.

## 2. KNN-based recommendations

In this lecture, we will implement a distance-based model. First, we put ourself in the non-personalised mode, after that we try to assign a _ranking score_ to user-item preference in order to encode the personalised ranking.

## 3. Collaborative filtering

The aim of this lecture is to built a model that exploits the collaborative filtering algorithm in order to predict the rating $y_{ij}$ a user $i$ gives to the movie $j$.
